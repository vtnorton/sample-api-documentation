# Changelog
We've got some exciting news to share! We've just rolled out a brand new feature that makes it super easy for companies to register their customers with associated bank accounts!


To get started, just head on over to the [customer register endpoint](./../reference/customer-register.md) and fill in the required customer details. Once you've created the customer, you'll need to [associate a bank account](./../reference/bank-account-association.md) with them before they can be [set as active](./../reference/customer-set-as-active.md).

We think this new feature is going to be a game-changer for our customers. It's simple, secure, and makes managing customer accounts and financial transactions easier! We're confident it's going to help our customers grow their businesses more effectively.

As always, we're dedicated to provide the best possible service to our customers, so, if you have any questions or feedback about this new feature, don't hesitate to reach out to us!
