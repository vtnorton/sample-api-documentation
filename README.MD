# Project Description

The "sample-api-documentation" project is a collection of markdown files that provide a structure for API documentation. It has been created based on the experience of a technical writer and aims to address common challenges faced by developers and technical writers when documenting APIs.

The documentation is divided into three main types: guides, reference, and changelog. Each type plays an important role in creating comprehensive and useful documentation.

## Guides

The "guides" section aims to provide information related to the business context of the API. It goes beyond simply listing information about each endpoint and explores the scenarios and workflows involved in using the API. This allows developers, usability experts, and product managers to understand what needs to be done to achieve specific goals.

A good guide should be understandable to both technical and non-technical individuals. It is important to consider ease of comprehension for different audiences.

## Reference

The "reference" section is the technical core of the documentation. It provides specific details about endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication information.

In the endpoint section, each endpoint is described clearly and concisely, including the HTTP method, URL, and a brief summary of its purpose. The request and response sections explain the expected formats and data types required for interacting with the API. The authentication section covers the authentication methods necessary to access API resources.

Additionally, it is considered useful to include a prerequisites section, highlighting any configuration or steps required before starting to use the API. This can help prevent issues and ensure a smooth experience for developers who are only consulting the reference section.

## Changelog

The "changelog" section is intended to highlight changes and updates made to the API over time. It is important to document modifications, additions, and removals of features.

By providing a changelog, you educate developers about new features and best practices for using them. It also allows them to understand the company's focus, future plans, and developer priorities. Additionally, listing resolved issues and known problems shows transparency and helps developers deal with potential challenges.

While the ideal scenario is to have an API without known problems, it is important to be transparent if there are any known issues. If there are known problems, it is recommended to list them only for APIs in beta stage to avoid confusion for users.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to the "sample-api-documentation" project. If you would like to contribute, there are several ways you can get involved:
